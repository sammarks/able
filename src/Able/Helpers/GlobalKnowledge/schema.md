# Global Knowledge Schema

The Global Knowledge system is basically the `etcd` cluster. The `etcd` cluster stores information
that pertains to all cluster nodes and containers within those nodes. This information is readily
accessible throughout the entire pool and is meant to contain information like account credentials
and information about currently running sites.

	_etcd /
		( currently running machines and the current leader are stored here )
		( see https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/clustering.md for more)
	containers / (array)
		(randomly generated uuid, container information expires every 60 seconds and needs to be repopulated by a
			cronjob on individual containers - this is how we keep track of containers that have stopped working) /
			machine: (the ID of the machine, generated by etcd)
			port: (the port for web traffic to forward to the machine)
			aliases: (the aliases the machine will respond to)
			status: (the status report generated by each of the features of the site)
	config /
		aws /
			access_key
			access_secret
	sites /
		(identifier) /
			containers: (a comma-separated list of container UUIDs)
			repository: (the location of the repository)
			branch: (the name of the branch to use when checking out the repository to deploy)
